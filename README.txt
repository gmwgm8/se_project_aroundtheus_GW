Rough Description:

This project implemented adaptive tools to allow the website to adjust to three different screen sizes.
The desire was to smoothly transition from Desktop, Tablet to Mobile while shrinking the browser window. 
To accomplish this, we utilized the @mediaquery tool and specified the screen size limits for Tablet and Mobile only. 
This is because Desktop screen size is the default. We also utilized Grid instead of Flexbox to allow the cards of the same size
to fall into desired alignment and spacing. We used Figma for the first time in detecting the desired margins and spacing of website features within desktop
and mobile screen sizes, tablet spaces were more or less inherited from the desktop styles along with a bit of my own determinations. 
Using Figma I did encounter some issues with calling out too many margins and spaces, but tutors did help me to weed these out.
